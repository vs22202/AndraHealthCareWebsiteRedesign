##### PROGRAM DETAILS

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

The ASHA is a woman resident in the community selected by her community, who is trained and supported to function in her own village / slum with a goal to provide primary medical care, advice on sanitation, hygiene, ante-natal and post-natal care, escorting expectant mothers to hospital for safe delivery.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Status of the programme**\
The selection of ASHA has been in near completion in rural areas of the state according to the norms laid by NRHM. The general norm will continue to be **"One ASHA"** per 1000 population. Where as in Urban habitations with a population of 50,000 and above one ASHA is selected for every 2000-2500 population. At present there are 37727 rural ASHAs and 2502 urban ASHAs in position.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

**Training**\
Capacity building of ASHA is a continuous process. Building ASHAs knowledge base and skills is critical in enhancing her effectiveness to achieve the desired health care outcomes. ASHAs in the state have now completed two rounds of HBNC training. The 3rd round of training is under process. Out of 37727 rural ASHAs, 34603 rural ASHAs received 1st round and 29710 up to 2nd round of training. With regard to urban ASHAs, 1387 completed 1st round and 1081 completed 2nd round. **The third round is under process**. Total Supervising staff trained as ASHA facilitators is 1634 and are trained in facilitator module and HBNC. They in turn give HBNC orientation to ASHAs on ASHA Day meeting.

They were particularly envisaged as being central to "local level community action" under NRHM. It provides an institutional mechanism for the community to be informed of health programmes and government initiatives. Further they also provide a platform for convergent action on social determinants and all public services directly or indirectly related to health. Annual untied fund of Rs.10000/- provided to GKS to take up local level action to address health related issues. ASHA is the member secretary and convenor of VHSNC . As on date, 12,958 VHSNCs are formed and training will be conducted through SERP (CRPs)

**Mahila Aarogya Samitis :** MAS is one of the key interventions under NUHM aimed at promoting community participation in health at all levels, including planning, implementing, and monitoring of health programs. MAS is expected to take collective action on issues related to health, nutrition, sanitation, water and social determinants at Slum level. Each MAS covers approximately up to 50-100 HHs at slum level. In the state of AP, MEPMA is involved in the constitution and training of MAS. As on date, 9015 MAS have been formed as against the target of 9988. At the district level, 8250 MAS have been trained.
